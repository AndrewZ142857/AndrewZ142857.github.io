<h3 id="I-The-President"><a href="#I-The-President" class="headerlink" title="I The President"></a><i>I</i> The President</h3><p class="p">
The President of the Federation stood behind an oval wooden desk. The national flag hung on the wall behind, with nineteen gold stars surrounding a black circle. The circle symbolized the Earth, the home planet that had become a wasteland in nuclear wars. The nineteen stars represented the nineteen Space Cities that joined hands after the collapse of the Iron Curtain between military alliances whose rivalry led to Home’s destruction – they were the founders of the Federation, or the so-called Bloody Fed.
</p>

<p class="p">
 “Mr. President, I wish you could seriously consider my proposal.” A visitor who was leaning on the oval desk said.
 </p>

<p class="p">
“Arthur...” The president was not backing down. 
</p>

<p class="p">
“Why are you being a sore thumb? I have to remind you that last month, Mitchell, Chen and 15 other senators in the Congress threatened to impeach. You. Some of them used to be your die-hard supporters.”
</p>

<p class="p">
“Wasn’t the final impeachment rejected?”
</p>

<p class="p">
“Mr. President, as your loyal friend, I would like to remind you, sincerely, that such luck won’t last long. The Polling Society has showed that your chances of winning the next election are below 40. People living in the pan-solar system blame your policies for the past decade of economic decline, regional conflicts, and rising income gaps. If you don’t make some changes to meet their expectations, Adams will probably beat you in the next election pretty ugly.”
</p>

<p class="p">
“Change what?”
</p>

<p class="p">
“You know it exactly. Raise taxes on minerals and fusion fuels produced in the Outer Solar System in next quarter’s trade arbitration, favoring those of the Inner Solar technology giants and processors... That way, 70 percent of the Conservative Party senators in the Congress will be on your side to ensure your re-election. Times have changed, my dear friend... Members of the Federal Congress only curry favor with districts that support them. If you keep them from earning interests, they will treat you as if you murdered their sons.”
</p>

<p class="p">
Silence. Stars and the sun flickered alternately outside the huge floor-to-ceiling windows of the Oval Office. In the distance, the Earth looked like a pale blue bead stained with an ominous green light. The green light was especially notable in the Earth’s night hemisphere, like an emerald ribbon wrapped in a blue pearl, and ultra visible under a velvety starry sky.
</p>

<p class="p">
People who grew up in their Space City hometown and had never experienced planetary gravity would recognize the green ribbon when they travelled millions of miles to visit their former mother planet. The green ribbon was a brilliant visualization of the high-energy nuclear radiation ionizing in the Earth’s atmosphere, a sign that the Earth completely became a Hadestown to humans and all other carbon-based life.
</p>

<p class="p">
The Bloody Fed rose from the ruins of the old world. For two hundred years, it had taken unity and solidarity as its supreme purpose. That’s still true today.
</p>

<p class="p">
After a long silence, the wrinkles on the President’s face did not smoothen. “Arthur, I know what they think of me... the Lightspeed Party detest me, while The Young Turks of conservatives want me to fully support them as the leader of the Conservative Party. But as the President, I cannot choose my side.”
</p>

<p class="p">
“The Constitution is a piece of broken antique,” the visitor pointed out unceremoniously. “The creators of the Fed did not take these circumstances into account when they made the Constitution. The new Fed was to them a fresh white canvas on which to cast their idealism. They naively wanted to build a new regime, free from the entrenched interest groups, a utopia that draws on the virtues and lessons of all national governments of the Earth age and is above all parties, provincial interests, individuals and prejudices; a Federal Government that will last forever, representing the voice of the people and reason, for the good and peace of all mankind. They did not expect a Congress that would drag on for 200 years with endless bickering, wrangling and fruitless partisan politics. Congress senators are no better than their predecessors at Home, for brazenly undermining the national interest to preserve their political standing. What is the spirit of the Constitution in such an age? Mr. President, your insistence, not idealistic, I call it romanticism. "
</p>

<p class="p">
“Well-practiced speech, Arthur.” The President smiled.
</p>

<p class="p">
“Mr. President...” The visitor seemed annoyed.
</p>

<p class="p">
“Anything to drink?” The president ducked the subject with a wave of his hand and pressed a button next to his desk. Soon a waiter in a white shirt brought a tray and placed two cups of coffee on the desk. The visitor sighed, stopped talking, and took up the coffee.
</p>

<p class="p">
After a while, the President suddenly said, “Arthur, I know what those people want, and I know what to do to please them. My only concern is... I have to do what the people need me to do before my term is over, not just to get re-elected with concession to my goal. This country is so divided, Arthur. You and me both know what will happen if the President of the Federation openly favors one party over another. I can’t have this country divided any more.”
</p>

<p class="p">
“But can you really change anything?”
</p>

<p class="p">
“We must try. As the old saying goes, necessity extorts sober judgment.”
</p>


<h3 id="II-The-S-A"><a href="#II-The-S-A" class="headerlink" title="II The S. A."></a><i>II</i> The S. A.</h3><p class="p">
On the 16th day of the flight, in the vast space between Venus and Earth…
</p>

<p class="p">
“I suppose you could still consider giving me a grant...” With a busy tone, a costly interplanetary call was forced to end. The man holding the receiver sighed. The 287th call? Or the 288th call? The number of rejections was countless, and he doesn’t like to count his failures.
</p>

<p class="p">
He managed an ugly smile. That’s probably why the donors didn’t like him. One shipping tycoon who did not want to support him left him a word: “Looks may not be very important to a politician. But if voters don’t like the way you look, no one will care what you say on politics.” He is a social activist, but on his name card his occupation writes “S. A.” Some people thought he was part of the Salvation Army. He had used his influence to raise a number of public issues in the past, but none of them had generated enough buzz to bring him into the public eyes and multiply his fortune. Perhaps in this age, there were plenty of political jerks like him who would do anything to become famous, pander to any point of view to gain support, and sell their views and consciences for money and votes -- possibly offer a discount to regular customers.
</p>


<p class="p">
It was just a job, wasn’t it?
</p>

<p class="p">
The phone rang again, and the man gave a casual glance at it at first. But when he saw the caller’s name, he answered the call immediately. After a short while, he nodded and agreed to the caller’s terms.
</p>

<p class="p">
He knew what the caller was up to: they were going to pass a bill in the Federal Congress that would impose tariffs on goods from the Outer Solar System to the Inner Solar market. Extra-solar products were cheap, thanks to their mineral wealth and assembly-line industrial systems. In any case, these commodities, shipped from billions of kilometers on interplanetary freighters, had had a significant impact on the Inner Solar market.
</p>

<p class="p">
“We need you. You just need to put forward a tariff bill in the Congress, and we’ll take over the next step.”
</p>

<p class="p">
Listening to the instructions on the phone, the man sneered and tapped his fingers on the table.
</p>

<p class="p">
“I will. What’ll be your price?”
</p>


<h3 id="III-The-Bounty-Hunter"><a href="#III-The-Bounty-Hunter" class="headerlink" title="III The Bounty Hunter"></a><i>III</i> The Bounty Hunter</h3><p class="p">
The mining cities of the Asteroid Belt were perpetually dark. There were no fusion lights to replace the sun’s role in normal Space Cities, only electrified, pale streetlights, a dim sun which was several AUs away, and barely visible stars through a glass ceiling to provide a little light. Besides, these mining cities had no way of simulating gravity with centrifugal force generated by rotation, as Space Cities had done. Residents either had to endure the weak suction provided by the large meteorites on which the city was built, or competed for the few artificial gravity chambers that were extremely expensive. The air circulation system was a relic of eighty years ago. The air was full of a pungent smell. No rich dude would live in such a place, where only miners and the urban poor, lured by cheap rents, would settle.
</p>

<p class="p">
“2,346, 2,347...” A shirtless man breathed heavily and counted his steps. He ran through the steel aisles, thudding against the ground with heavy footsteps.
</p>

<p class="p">
Without warning, the watch popped up a bright blue holographic window. The man raised his arm and clicked, then an encrypted window was opened.
</p>

<p class="p">
There was a hint of irritation in the man’s voice. “As I said, I’m not working for you anymore.”
</p>

<p class="p">
A voice said, “We’ll pay you enough. You are the best candidate we can find.”
</p>

<p class="p">
“You’ll ruin my life."
</p>

<p class="p">
“You aren’t satisfied with your life, are you? Living in a slum with no future, depending on government benefits and charity... Not many people in the underworld remember you now, and what you did.”
</p>

<p class="p">
The man’s eyelids flickered slightly.
</p>

<p class="p">
“With your permission,” the voice added, “your wife and daughter will receive the best care, whether or not the mission is successful... If you agree to our terms, we will send you all the details of the mission.”
</p>

<p class="p">
After hanging up the phone, the man was silent for a while. There was a slight “DING” sound on his watch, and an E-mail arrived.
</p>

<p class="p">
After a brief look, the man frowned and mused for long. Then he booked a flight to the Space City, the capital, leaving in three days.
</p>

<p class="p">
His daughter’s medical treatment required a large sum of money.
</p>


<h3 id="IV-The-President’s-Visit"><a href="#IV-The-President’s-Visit" class="headerlink" title="IV The President’s Visit"></a><i>IV</i> The President’s Visit</h3><p class="p">
The president had a lot on his plate these days. In a space shuttle, he sailed to and from all corners of the Solar System, including the City of Clouds suspended in the thick atmosphere of Venus, the semi-underground metal fortress of Mercury under the scorching sun, the sunless rare-earth mines of the Asteroid Belt, and the vast steel mega-structures in the shadow of Jupiter. It took him three months to reach the outer reaches of Neptune’s orbit, a remote outpost infinitely close to the frontier of Human Civilization. Its inhabitants huddled in a “tiny metal can”, and the tiny space city was barely a dust in the vast void in the Outer Solar System. The President traveled through the whole Solar System, shaking hands with every voter he met and making his voice heard in every corner of the civilized world. He spread his belief that the human beings in the grand Solar System were all brothers and sisters. The Inner and Outer Solar Systems must find ways to coexist in harmony while their economic systems complement each other. Some saw him as a slogan-chanting visionary, some as a keeper of a fragile peace, some as a devoted idealist... Like a threading needle, he managed to stitch together a piece of torn cloth - the Federation in its most divided period - that was about to fall apart. But anyone could see the fragility of the situation: the fabric’s integrity depended entirely on the presence of this needle. If one day it was pulled away, the rag would break all the threads without hesitation, let the cracks grow freely, and finally completely fell apart.
</p>

<p class="p">
The Conservatives in the Congress had all the support of the Inner Solar System within the orbit of Mars. Beyond this vast territory was the Lightspeed Party’s solid vote storehouse. The contradiction between the two was irreconcilable, because there was a great gap between their economic forms, social systems and ideology. A united Federation? Politicians didn’t daydream.
</p>

<p class="p">
The President remembered a boy standing up in the dim light of the electric lights in that tiny metal town hall on the edge of human land and asking him, “Mr. President, you always say that the entire Solar System is supposed to be brothers and sisters, but since when do the bastards of the Inner Solar System call us brothers or sisters? They deny us the export of good products, obstruct our manufacturing, and oppose our exploitation of rich frontiers of the Outer Solar System on the grounds of environmental protection and resource conservation... We could have been better off without them!”
</p>

<p class="p">
The President couldn’t answer him. In fact, the people of the Inner Solar System had a similar but opposite bias: they regarded the people from Outer Solar System as a collection of lunatics and desperadoes who wasted and ruined the rich natural resources of outer planets in a rough and cheap way, with no regard for the possible environmental consequences. What’s more, the people of the Inner Solar System resented the fact that products from the outer solar system tremendously invaded their markets at low prices, leaving local products in the back of nowhere. Economic Protectionism had not only risen in recent years. It came down to the anger in the hearts of people who had lost their jobs.
</p>

<p class="p">
There was a lot of bigotry, estrangement, hatred... call it whatever you want. Some called it a mountain of despair on the path of mutual understanding and tolerance in the Solar System, but the president thought it would be better to call it an abyss, which had a physical carrier - the vast expanse of space millions of miles apart from any two cities in the Solar System. How was it possible for a person to empathize with the life of another person hundreds of millions of kilometers away, to understand his joy, his pain, and his hardships, when they were cut off by astronomical distance? The Inner and Outer Solar Systems were not devoid of attempts to ease tensions through communication, but what was the meaning of communication? They both could not put themselves in another’s shoes, and sooner or later everything would descend into a zero-sum game in which no one would win.
</p>

<p class="p">
The President sometimes felt lost. He sometimes even doubted the meaning of his struggle. He always recalled his youth in a space city orbiting around Jupiter. The space city he once lived in was quite large, with a population of seven million. To mimic the Earth’s environment, the space city even retained a primeval forest: he used to wander through the forest paths and watch frightened squirrels leap from tree to tree. In the dense forest where no one could see him, he could finally put down his serious disguise and show his sincere and worry-free smile. It was his choice to go into the mess of politics after graduation from college. He started as a lawyer, became an Assistant MP, an MP, a Deputy Speaker, and eventually became the President. Only when he became the President did he truly witness that society was on its deathbed: high unemployment rates, torn poles, huge disparities between rich and poor... The scariest problem was the political and economical rise of the Outer Solar System in recent decades, which had challenged the traditional political order in a delicate balance. The Outer and Inner Solar Systems became two distinct camps, forming two large parties that fought over their interests in the Congress. People on both sides were also misled into believing that the other was to blame for their unhappy lives. Sometimes the President asked himself what the point was: if the federal government was willing to act as a mediator between the Inner and Outer Solar Systems, it would one day be undermined and the Solar System would be essentially split apart. But if the government did not intervene or took sides, the conflict between the two sides was bound to worsen and some day lead to the bitter consequences of war.
</p>

<p class="p">
The President could not help thinking of his failing health. At the last physical examination, the doctor gently told him that he was often stressed and had accumulated many chronic diseases, which would bring him painful suffering in his later years. He also knew that his erratic sleep habits had taken a toll on him since becoming the President. Were these all for nothing? Couldn’t he really change anything? If he gave up the presidency, would he be able to return to the ease of his youth?
</p>

<p class="p">
Not at all. The President shook his head. He must had changed something. Perhaps a bloody war was averted? Perhaps the great depression awaiting in the future was bypassed? And he was convinced that there must be a way for the Inner and Outer Solar Systems to coexist peacefully. Both sides could give full play to their own advantages to support complementary industries and resolve economic conflicts. Through tourism exchanges and cultural integration of both sides, the contradiction between people was not difficult to resolve. These were fairly long-term plans that he, and his successor, would have to take one step in consecutive presidential terms at a time. Now that he was in the position of the President, he should shoulder that responsibility. The President consoled himself with this all the time.
</p>

<p class="p">
Maybe just for my family, to ensure that they live in a safe world. The President added another reason to continue his journey.
</p>

<p class="p">
He lectured at mines in the Asteroid Belt. In the last century, this region suffered from over-exploitation: many of the Inner Solar System’s opportunities arrived in hope for a mineral-rich asteroid and to obtain exclusive mining rights granted by the Federation Laws. For these precious legacies from the Solar Nebula Era 4.6 billion years ago, the people of those days went desperately crazy. What was the legacy of that crazy history? Slum-like mining cities, mineral waste abandoned by inefficient mining techniques, and giant meteorites blasted into pieces... Perhaps people of the Inner Solar System were right to worry.
</p>

<p class="p">
The new year was approaching, and the President’s plan to travel all over the Solar System had to come to an end: he had to return to the Federal Capitol Space City in the Earth’s orbit, where he would preside over the Congress. What trouble would those selfish congress dudes bring him? The president sighed, preparing for the worst.
</p>


<h3 id="V-The-Congress"><a href="#V-The-Congress" class="headerlink" title="V The Congress"></a><i>V</i> The Congress</h3><p class="p">
The President did not expect that the Federal Congress lasted for three full days. During the three days, a representative sided with the Inner Solar System introduced a bill that would lead the Federal Government to raise taxes on metals, liquid hydrogen and light industrial products exported from the Outer Solar System to the Inner Solar System, in order to save the Venus-Mercury Industrial Belt from collapse due to low market prices. Not surprisingly, all the representatives of the Outer Solar System rose unanimously to oppose the proposal. Because the two sides had a similar number of seats in the Congress, the bill collapsed in the final vote because it lacked a simple majority. On the rostrums, the President was already exhausted: for three days he had to act as a peacemaker in the midst of fierce clashes between the two sides, trying to keep the Congress in order - no easy task. After three grueling days, reporters with a keen sense of smell swarmed like sharks at the smell of blood to block delegates exiting the convention hall, hoping to catch the first glimpse of breaking news. The President’s answers to reporter must be carefully scrutinized. Because his answer represented the attitude of the federal government, which must be neutral, detached, and never take sides. The situation could not worsen. He couldn’t be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.
</p>

<p class="p">
“Mr. President, do you consider this conference a success?”
</p>

<p class="p">
“Of course,” the president smiled amiably. “I’m glad to see that after a fruitful debate, both sides were able to put aside their divergences and eventually reach a compromise as well as a win-win result. After all, peace and stability in the Solar System are the common goal for all of us, who strive of peace and love across the Solar System.”
</p>

<p class="p">
“Mr. President, do you agree that the federal government is taking sides in this trade dispute?”
</p>

<p class="p">
“The Federal Government is the defender and guardian of universal peace and all people across the Solar System. It never speaks for the interests of any region or any political power. The federal government has always been committed to democracy and prosperity in the Solar System with a view to the well-being of all humanity. As the great compromise reached at this conference shows, there are no irreconcilable contradictions between the Inner and Outer Solar Systems. The tragic destruction of our home planet is the history’s lesson, and a constant reminder of what happens when human evil spirals out of control. The fact that the Iron Curtain was finally broken when the nineteen Space Cities established our Federation proves that the brotherhood of mankind can transcend race and prejudice... In the future, I hope that the Federal Government will continue to exist as a bridge builder and mediator between the two sides to preserve the hard-won unity and peace of the human world.”
</p>

<p class="p">
“Mr. President...”
</p>

<p class="p">
“Mr. President...”
</p>

<p class="p">
A man frowned at the nearby President talking to the camera. He felt nothing for the President’s fiery speech. He was quietly gauging the distance between himself and the President, knowing that he had no chance of success now. Fortunately, he had prepared for it. He disguised himself as a journalist, carrying a giant video camera, hidden inside which was an assembled mechanical pistol. He managed to sneak past the metal detectors and got close to the President. But it’s not close enough. He needed to be a little closer still...
</p>

<p class="p">
The man strode over to the President with a professional smile. He greeted him by saying, “Mr. President,” and smiled, just like any reporter around. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he was only five meters from the President...
</p>

<p class="p">
He pulled the trigger.
</p>

<p class="p">
Bang!
</p>

<p class="p">
Pandemonium.
</p>

<p class="p">
The President was surrounded by trained bodyguards, and several doctors gave him an emergency dressing for his wounds. But it did not help: the President’s lips turned pale, for he had lost too much blood.
</p>

<p class="p">
The President’s suit was stained with blood from a bullet that had passed through his body. He slumped to the ground and watched helplessly as the crowd screamed and fled. He needed not speak any more. His hand shook and tried to raise up, but at last it dropped feebly. His lips faltered meekly, and only a lip-reader could see what he was trying to say. But no lip-reader was here to read his final words. Everyone was pointing their camera at the gunman. He pointed his gun toward the starry sky, and shouted,
</p>

<p class="p">
“Shoot the bloody Fed!”
</p>


<h3 id="VI-Populists"><a href="#VI-Populists" class="headerlink" title="VI Populists"></a><i>VI</i> Populists</h3><p class="p">
Space City 116, Mars orbit, Inner Solar System.
</p>

<p class="p">
In a dimly lit room, two men were talking.
</p>

<p class="p">
“There’s going to be a major overhaul of the Fed.”
</p>

<p class="p">
“Now the President is assassinated, they will go back to the polls to elect a new president. But the Inner Solar System has a huge majority of votes, and it’s up to them to decide who becomes the President. As a result, the new President is bound to tilt toward the interests of the Inner Solar System, wiping out his predecessor’s efforts maintaining the balance. Just wait and see, the conflicts will shower.”
</p>

<p class="p">
“Well. Will there be a war?”
</p>

<p class="p">
“I don’t know, just pray... Pray that our new President is not a fool, pray that he is not kidnapped by populist forces... If he does things wrong, war will come immediately.”
</p>

<p class="p">
Outside the window the sound of the procession rose, which was a long-planned outburst, like a wave of anger in a pressure cooker that broke out at the last minute. The marchers blamed unemployment, recession, and soaring prices on hundreds of millions of people in the Outer Solar System who they had never met. From time to time it was common to see inflammatory slogans, like “Send the enemy to the hell!” “Stop those lunatics!” “To reclaim our golden age!”, were held aloft. What appeared the most was that gunman’s quote, “Shoot the bloody Fed!” Everyone shouted slogans in unison and waved in a chilling gesture.
</p>

<p class="p">
The two men in the room remained silent for a long time.
</p>

<p class="p">
“You may be right. Maybe war will break out in two years, or a year from now, maybe tomorrow. Who knows? We should get prepared for that early.”
</p>

<p class="p">
“What can we do to prepare... Don’t they know? In war…people die.”
</p>


<h3 id="VII-Tomorrow"><a href="#VII-Tomorrow" class="headerlink" title="VII Tomorrow"></a><i>VII</i> Tomorrow</h3><p>When the flames of war engulfing the entire Solar System burst forth, no one could stay away from it. Invaluable peace maintained for two centuries had come to an end, and warships were once again on the move in the human world. The war was between the Inner Solar System sided with the Conservative Party Federal Government, and the Lightspeed Party Interstellar Federation supported by the Outer Solar System. The Inner Solar System had taken most of the force from the heritage of the Federal Fleet, and so had launched an acute offense at the beginning of the war. In response, the Outer Solar System relied on a broad strategic depth to fight against the Inner Solar Fleet, and on its strong industrial capacity to produce a steady stream of star ships, supporting the front line. Soon the Outer Solar Fleet was firmly established in Jupiter’s orbit after a successful military operation against the ISF defensive force. Then the two sides began a three-year standoff in the Asteroid Belt.</p>
<p></p>

<p class="p">
For the vast majority of ordinary people, war was a distant and vague term, meaning only shortages of daily necessities, rationing food and compulsory military service. Many did not see fire until the end of the war - both the ISF and OSF tacitly avoided inhabited Space Cities in their battles, as each side tried to avoid killing civilians. Few people thought about the causes of war. But good news was that people in the future decades would be able to look up all the records in the vast archives of the old Fed and drew their own conclusions.
</p>

<p class="p">
In 2265 AD, Federal President Wilde was assassinated. During his presidency, President Wilde actively promoted mutual understanding and compromises between the Inner and Outer Solar Systems by avoiding conflicts between them. Thanks to his efforts, the Solar System enjoyed a fragile peace during his tenure. After Wilde’s death, according to the Emergency Election Act, a new President was elected within a month. The new President came to power with the support of the voters from the Inner Solar System. In return, his policies completely favor the Inner Solar System over the protests of the Outer Solar System. After a series of irrational policies made by the new President, the conflict finally intensified beyond control. In 2267 AD, soldiers mutiny occurred in the Federal Fleet. Soldiers from the Outer Solar System hijacked warships to protest the unjust treatments. The new President overrode all opinions and took a tough approach to the incident, using strategic weapons to destroy the hijacked warships. Unsurprisingly, two months later, the Federal Fleet broke up, and some of the warships announced to leave the Command of the Federal Fleet, sailing out of the Jupiter Battleship Foundation, and finally arriving in the Neptune orbit, where they were treated like heroes. At the beginning of the year 2268 AD, war broke out.

One of the most important debates among historians was whether the collapse of the Federation would have been delayed by a few years had Wilde not been assassinated. Both sides of the argument had a large number of scholars in favor. Some argued that the Inner and Outer Solar Systems had been in conflict for many years, reaching irreconcilable levels before the assassination of President Wilde. People in the Inner Solar System believed that cheap minerals and light industrial products from the Outer Solar System ruined their economy and took away their jobs, while the Outer Solar System resented the high tariffs imposed by the Inner Solar System on their exports, which hindered the further development of the Outer Solar industry. Individual influence alone was far from bringing the two sides to the negotiating table to compromise peacefully. In other words, even if President Wilde had not been assassinated in 2265 AD, wars would still have been fought over the fundamental conflicts between both sides. Other scholars, in contrast, believed that President Wilde did give many people hope for maintaining peace in the Solar System. If Wilde had lived beyond 2265 AD, perhaps his even-handed style of presidency would have delayed the war by defusing the fierce conflict between the Inner and Outer Solar Systems.

It was interesting to note that few scholars believed in President Wilde’s dream: conditions existed for peaceful coexistence between the Inner and Outer Solar Systems, and it was realistic for the both sides to reach a compromise under the supervising power of the Federal Government, and maintain the long-term peace and stability of the Solar System. Most historians agree that President Wilde’s solution was merely a beautiful chimera.

Unfortunately, there was no assumptions in history. The story we knew was that the civil war broke out with the collapse of the old Federation in 2267 AD as internal conflicts accumulated to the limit. In those five years, three million died and 271 main warships were destroyed. The rise of the new Federation from the ruins of the old offered the ultimate answer to Wilde’s problem. War. Only war could fully resolve the tensions in the old Federation, destroy the tangled old forces, and preserve its unity with a treaty signed under coercion. In the march of the history, we should reflect on why the vast majority of conflicts had to end in violence, but not through less damaging and more peaceful negotiations and compromises.

This, perhaps, was the eternal flaw of human reason.
