<p class="p2">I have translated it into English for potential reviewers' convenience. The original text was written in Mandarin.</p>

<p class="p1">
Mossy concrete walls were mosaics of romantic stories. Colored asphalt roads that patch the earth, and a putrefied air made the world look lousier and more battered. Yang blamed the broken garbage truck, shuffled absently in his slippers, kicking a small stone. The golden age of this flat building had vanished long before he entered it. The handrails in the staircases were rusted crimson, and there were none yellowing posters to peel off the walls. Up the stairs to the second floor, Yang fumbled for a house key in his empty, army-green cloth bag. There was no decent furniture in the room, and his television had only a grainy smonochromatic screen and a rustling sound. Outside the glass window were with the dark red sky and the barren, endless dark red earth. This was a beat-up, shabby world.

</p><p class="p1">
They were young once, in the age of movies, romanticism and passion. Half a century ago, more than a dozen nations on Earth joined forces, spent a fortune that would have brought down the richest nations on the planet, and, through hundreds of rocket launches, built the most powerful spacecraft ever to orbit the earth. A thousand young talents were selected to volunteer in this great project and open up new frontiers for human civilization. Once, a thousand of them, witnessed by billions of people, embarked on a long, soul-shattering journey to the crimson planet they now treaded on.

</p><p class="p1">
One their way, people looked through telescopes at the stars at night and imagined all walks of life forms in deep space. At that time, people still believed canals excited on Mars. When they landed, one thousand talents carried out their plans perfectly, putting up solar power arrays as scheduled and building glass walls to protect them. Electricity was key.

</p><p class="p1">
The new world didn’t welcome them with the Garden of Eden. On the sixth day after they settled down on this planet, a storm swept through the valley. The sun was blocked out by a cloud of dust that stained the glass walls. Soon the electricity went out and the temperature inside the glass walls plunged to minus 30 degrees to a point ice burst through water pipes.

</p><p class="p1">
But they survived. Every day after that, people put on spacesuits and went outside to clean up the dust. Inside the walls, buildings sprung up, simple roads started to connect different compartments, and scientific research resumed as originally planned. These interplanetary explorers strived to turn Mars into a paradise, but no one could predict which side of the paradise they would be living in.

</p><p class="p1">
Every few years, periodic global storms would sweep across much of the planet’s surface, throwing dust high into the crimson Martian sky, with only a few remaining peaks visible in the outer space. Earth scientists had long known about this phenomenon, but vastly underestimated its power. The storm was mixed with bits of grit and sharp dust particles, which left gut-wrenching scratches on the glass walls. Once the glass walls crumbled, the fresh air inside would be drained away in a fleeting moment, leaving everyone to die of suffocation. 

</p><p class="p1">
Yang remembered that when he was young, he was so vigorous that he signed up for the Maintenance Group to protect the settlement. There was a friend in the Group called Ye. Ye was in his early 20s, a little shy boy who talked little with others. 

</p><p class="p1">
One day, over 20 workers put on their spacesuits and went out into the storm through the airlock chamber. Once outside, their helmets were immediately covered with Martian dust. They climbed a ductile rope against Martian gravity up to a glass wall, followed their navigator’s instructions to the weak spots in the wall, and filled the gaps with synthetic polymer created from allyl methyl sulfide. They were on their way to repair the ninth crack, the dust and sand of the storm suddenly gathered. 

</p><p class="p1">
Faster than anyone could react, a tiny rock hit Ye’s mask at a rate of several meters per second, creating a crack across the helmet. The oxygen leak seemed like a white mist through the broken helmet. Ye panicked and lost his grip on the railing of the wall, and he fell straight down. He was the first life taken by Mars.

</p><p class="p1">
Yang, like all the others, attended Ye’s funeral. There was no time for tears. In his heart, Yang felt responsible for his dear friend’s death. He was right next to him when the tragedy happened, and he could have grasped his hand. But he was shocked, or frightened, that he let it happen.

</p><p class="p1">
Ye’s death was only a dampened prologue. Over the next few years, more than a dozen people died on this crimson land. What really destroyed them spiritually, however, had not yet happened.

</p><p class="p1">
In the seventh year, they reinforced the glass walls to withstand common dust storms. Meanwhile, some small power stations had been built at the base. The settlers cheered, thinking that this marked the beginning of their golden age. Indeed, the frequency of cleaning glass walls could be reduced to once every five days, and everyone was getting more electricity rationing, so they could even watch streaming programs from the Earth. 

</p><p class="p1">
Despair came just as quickly as hope, after all happy moments had gone. By the end of the eighth year of their arrival, exciting news had spread through the crowd: A baby was to be born on this new planet! The settlers of Mars were about to welcome their first child under the crimson sky. For the following ten months, however, people waited for a nightmare to come. Perhaps due to low gravity, the human body had undergone some unfavorable changes. This Martian baby was born with a fatal defect and died ten days after his birthday. No one had time to mourn except his poor mother. For all had heard the death knell of the Martian migration.

</p><p class="p1">
With only half the gravity of the Earth, the impact of Mars on newborns could be more severe than expected. With no previous experience of giving birth in low-gravity environments, people were totally unprepared, and this population of just 1,000 people on Mars would not be able to reproduce and survive. On the day when the last of them died of age, there would be no more human beings on Mars.

</p><p class="p1">
At first, only some people were absent-minded at work. Riots, chaos, and loss of order didn’t appear. Gradually, all settlers seemed to be absorbed in some kind of epic melancholy. Infrastructure projects had been stalled, the glass walls were only occasionally cleaned, and pedestrians wandered aimlessly like a walking dead. Suffering and sacrifice did not destroy them, but a little baby did.

</p><p class="p1">
Then the world became what it was: dark spots on the glass walls, cracks in the pavement, and everything seemed decadent, depraved and lost. People had nothing to do: some were immersed in virtual reality, while others numbed themselves with drugs, and many more were just living by instinct of eating and sleeping. Yang, being older and less inclined to think as much as others, remained sane. But a life of nonsense, surrounded him like a killer, waiting for a chance to break his nerve at his most vulnerable moments. Perhaps, in time, he too would be sinking in mayhem and madness.

</p><p class="p1">
In fact, Martians had tried to catch the last straw: they turned to their Earth homeland for help. But the thrill for preparing another grand journey was gone, and the Earth could not afford it once more. The witnesses on Earth aged with them, only to leave the next generation growing up in poverty, physically and mentally, confused and irritated by this legendary Martian mission. The settlers could only die in this distant land, sleeping beneath the strange crimson sand.

</p><p class="p1">
Yang pushed open the rusty window and peered out at the featureless, speckled glass walls, looking at the faint sunshine. After travelling more than 200 million kilometers through the lonely, dark space, the sun’s rays had been no longer warm by the time they reached Mars, leaving the planet’s atmosphere hovering around minus 50 degrees Celsius. In the eternal cold, the beautiful home built by mankind was just a fleeting shadow, as if it never existed.

</p><p class="p1">
Yang lost in his own thoughts when the noise downstairs rose above the ambient background and caught his attention. It was two drunk men, staggering downstairs, gossiping. Something must be happening. An excitement struck him. He hadn’t felt it in decades. Yang grabbed the key and went downstairs. Then he realized what the two drunks were looking at.

</p><p class="p1">
Through a high-rise window, they were staring at a thin, pale man with his eyes closed. There were no guardrails at the windows: if he walked one step forward, he would fall into an ultimate, crimson silence.

</p><p class="p1">
At that moment, Yang suddenly, out of nowhere, thought of a movie they watched half a century ago, at the departure pep rally.

</p><p class="p3">
The planet’s atmosphere revealed its presence. A hundred landers’ shells burnt red. Soon they were going to parachute down, with pulse thrusters easing their final descent. Above, a transport ship docked in planetary orbit, in the eternal and grand silence of universe, leaving the capsule doors open. 

</p><p class="p3">
Machines and levitation vehicles slided to the ground. Several intelligent creatures, nearly two meters high and walking on two legs, emerged, wrapped in their lightweight air-tight suits. No time to enjoy the magnificence of this strange star, they set to build up a temporary base, disc in shape. For the next six months, the creatures watched their enormous, roaring machines run in absolute silence, altering the chemistry of atmosphere above their heads. They also explored every piece of the planet’s surface, peaking at 500 kilometers per hour, for mineral veins and hidden mountains. Six months later, the most spectacular chapter of this planet in its lifetime has arrived.

</p><p class="p3">
All the spacecrafts in the fleet were dispatched. They scoured the outer edges of the galaxy for icy comets, using fusion engines to push them into planetary orbits. After the atmospheric modification, there were more than two thousand comets in place. They reflected beams of particles from far-off black holes, emitting bluish fluorescence. On top of these colossal blocks of ice were WorkMechs, who were disassembling the fusion engines at an unbelievable speed, singing no songs. Kinetic energy weapons and gravity would send these comets, from sizes of tens of to thousands of meters, off to their final voyage. The ships’ electromagnetic cannons fired space rocks cut into small spheres. The rocks slammed into the comets, and ice sublimated into water vapor. Thousands of comets blazed across the sky. They fell upon the earth. Hundreds of millions of frozen years had become puddles in collisions, leaving tiny droplets of vapor in the atmosphere. It took three months for the dust kicked up to fall. By then, there was water: water the meteorites brought had covered the low-lying areas of the planet, and for the first time there had been oceans of liquid water on this gray-black rocky planet. Some water formed endless blue seas; some strewed the landmasses, connecting with each other by narrow channels resembling rivers. The whole planet looked like a blue-black jewel from space.

</p><p class="p3">
During the comets’ bombardment, the landing pioneers stayed in their fortified bases. When the dust settled, they all put on their spacesuits and drove around town in colorful vehicles, drifting sometimes, scattering microbes carried all the way from Home. Over the next decades, these hardy little creatures would spread across the planet, continuing to modify the atmosphere and the soil. After that, they would bring plants and animals from Home. One day, they could walk on this land, topless, barefoot, and said to themselves - they had founded a new world. God bless!

</p><p class="p1">
When Yang saw the blood around him, he could hardly believe that so much blood had come out of his body. He could hardly breathe, but he heaved a sigh of relief when he felt the man’s heart beating.

</p><p class="p1">
In his last moments, Yang couldn’t think of anything else. He looked into the sky higher and farther beyond the glass walls. He remembered every detail of it. 

</p><p class="p1">
Then the crimson faded. The end.
